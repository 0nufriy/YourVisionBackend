The repository contains all the necessary code and configurations to manage the backend functionality, including database interactions, API endpoints, and business logic.

## Features

- Built using **C#** and **Entity Framework**.
- Implements a robust database architecture for efficient data management.
- RESTful API endpoints to support frontend integration.
- Scalable and extensible codebase.
- Supports modern development practices like dependency injection and asynchronous programming.
